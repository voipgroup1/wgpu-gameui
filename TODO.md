# wgpu-gameui TODO

Consolidated from two independent audits (Claude + Codex) on 2026-04-26 of the
~2,630 LOC source tree just extracted from citybuilder. Both audits agreed on
the same major gaps. Items grouped by category and tagged with priority:

- **P0** — blocks 1.0 / blocks Teardown-API port
- **P1** — important, but the lib is usable without it
- **P2** — nice-to-have

Use this as the working backlog for the package. Cross items off as PRs land.

---

## Architecture / Core Plumbing

- [x] **P0 — Public `UiRenderer`/`Backend`** that owns the wgpu pipeline, sampler,
      atlas, and consumes a `DrawList` per frame. (`src/render/ui_renderer.rs`)
- [x] **P0 — Texture atlas / sprite registry.** Dynamic shelf packer with grow
      (`src/render/atlas.rs`), `load_sprite_rgba8` + `register_nine_slice` on
      `UiRenderer`. `IconDraw`/`NineSliceDraw` now carry pre-resolved
      `SpriteId`/`NineSliceId` with name fallback.
- [x] **P0 — Matrix / transform stack** (`UiPush`/`UiPop`/`UiTranslate`/`UiAlign`/
      `UiCenter`/`UiRotate`/`UiScale`). 2x3 affine stack lives on `DrawList`
      so existing widgets that take absolute `Rect`s pick it up transparently;
      `UiContext` (`src/ui_context.rs`) is the Teardown-verb façade.
- [x] **P0 — Color / tint stack** (`UiColor`/`UiColorFilter`) with sub-tree alpha
      multiplier. Lives alongside the transform stack on `DrawList`; primitive
      methods multiply input color by current tint at push time.
- [x] **P0 — Clip / scissor stack.** `push_clip(rect)`/`pop_clip()` with draw
      commands grouped per clip stack. `Table::draw_cell` text is currently
      *not actually clipped* by `content_rect`.
- [ ] **P1 — Unify widget API around `DrawContext` + `Rect`.** Today some
      widgets are structs with `draw`/`draw_at`, some are unit structs with
      assoc fns, some are free functions. `DrawContext` exists in
      `src/widgets/mod.rs` but is unused.
- [x] **P1 — Replace `String` keys in draw commands with interned `IconId`/
      `SpriteId`/`u32` handles** produced by the atlas. (Both still accept
      string-keyed helpers for ergonomics; `icon_sprite`/`nine_slice_id` are the
      allocation-free path.)
- [ ] **P1 — Don't `unwrap()` glyphon errors in `TextRenderer::prepare`/
      `render`** (`src/text.rs:103,130`). Bubble as a typed `UiError`.
- [ ] **P1 — Cache glyphon `Buffer`s by content+size hash or pool them.**
      Currently a fresh buffer is built per `TextBlock` per frame.

---

## Draw Primitives

- [x] **P0 — Rounded rectangles.** `theme.border_radius` exists but is never
      used. Teardown's `UiRoundedRect` is widely used. Tessellate or SDF.
- [x] **P0 — Lines / strokes** (`line(p0, p1, thickness, color)`) with
      thickness/joins/caps/AA. Teardown's `DrawLine` is top-30. Also needed
      for slider tick marks, debug overlays.
- [x] **P1 — Circles / arcs / ellipses** (`DrawList::circle`, `circle_outline`, `stroked_arc`; `UiContext::circle`, `circle_outline`).
- [x] **P1 — Textured quad with explicit UV rect.** Atlas `AtlasRegion::uv()`
      drives icon UVs, with optional tint per draw.
- [x] **P1 — Nine-slice border metadata.** `register_nine_slice(name, sprite,
      border)` on `UiRenderer` records source rect (via SpriteId) + per-side
      borders, with tint per draw.
- [ ] **P2 — Gradient helpers** (linear/radial). Per-vertex color exists but
      no constructor.
- [ ] **P2 — Text outline / shadow** (`UiTextOutline`, `UiTextShadow`).

---

## Widgets

- [x] **P0 — Dropdown / combo / select.** `Dropdown<'a>` + caller-owned
      single-owner `DropdownState`/`DropdownId` (one open at a time, like
      `FocusState`). Button drawn inline; the open list floats in a `Popup`
      layer pushed at frame-top (blocks clicks underneath). Click/Esc/
      click-outside close, hover highlight, selected highlight, scroll-clipped
      past `max_visible`. `src/widgets/dropdown.rs`. Keyboard nav + Tab-focus
      deferred (P1 below).
- [x] **P1 — Dropdown keyboard nav.** Arrow Up/Down + Enter to select, and
      register the dropdown in `FocusState` so Tab reaches it (open with
      Space/Enter). Same-frame open on keyboard activation (geom set immediately
      so the list appears without a one-frame delay). `Dropdown::draw` takes
      `&mut DrawContext` (which bundles `DrawList` + `FocusState` + `Theme` +
      `InputState` + screen dimensions). `key_up`/`key_down`/`key_space` added
      to `InputState`.
- [x] **P0 — ScrollView / scroll container** (general — `ScrollView` widget
      with caller-owned `ScrollState`, vertical+horizontal scroll, wheel
      input, draggable thumb, lives in `src/widgets/scroll_view.rs`. `Table`
      now uses it).
- [x] **P0 — Modal / dialog / popup layer** with z-order stacking and input
      gobbling. `LayerStack` in `src/layer.rs` plus
      `UiContext::modal_begin`/`modal_end`/`popup_begin`/`popup_end`.
      `InputState::mouse_consumed` tracks layer-dispatch capture.
- [x] **P0 — Popup / portal layer** for dropdowns, context menus, tooltips.
      `LayerStack::push_popup`/`push_tooltip`. Tooltip refactored to render
      onto its own layer via `TooltipLayer::draw_into_layers`.
- [x] **P0 — Image / sprite widget** with sizing/aspect/tinting/UV-rect.
      `Image` (`src/widgets/image.rs`) draws a `SpriteId` or string key into a
      dest box with `ImageFit` (Stretch/Contain/Cover/ScaleDown/None),
      `ImageAlign`, tint, and automatic UV cropping for `Cover` (via
      `DrawList::image_cropped`). Natural size supplied by the caller (from
      `UiRenderer::image_size`); aspect fits fall back to Stretch without it.
- [x] **P1 — Image / icon button.** `ImageButton`
      (`src/widgets/image_button.rs`) layers the `Image` widget (full
      `ImageFit`/`ImageAlign`/tint) over `Button`-style chrome with
      hover/press/disabled feedback, returning a click bool like `Button`.
      `.bare()` drops the chrome (image is the hit target, overlay-only
      feedback); `.padding()` insets the image. Disabled dims via overlay so
      string-key sources without tint still read as disabled.
- [ ] **P1 — Radio button group.**
- [ ] **P1 — Tree view / collapsing header.**
- [ ] **P1 — Number input / spin box** with validation. TextInput is raw text.
- [ ] **P1 — Drag handle / window-mover.**
- [ ] **P1 — List / grid / virtualized list.** Table is the only iterator.
- [ ] **P2 — Color picker.**
- [ ] **P2 — Separator / divider.**
- [ ] **P2 — Toast / notification / banner.**
- [ ] **P2 — Group / titled panel** (workshop equivalent of `UiWindow`).
- [x] **P1 — Tooltip hover delay actually works.** `TooltipLayer::tick(dt,
      input)` accumulates hover time per region; `is_visible()` only
      returns true once the configured `with_delay_ms` has elapsed.
- [x] **P1 — Slider drag capture identity.** `DragCapture`/`DragId`
      (`src/widgets/drag.rs`) arbitrate a single drag owner across the UI.
      `Slider::draw` now takes `id: DragId` + `&mut DragCapture` instead of a
      caller `bool`, claims the drag only when the capture is free, and updates
      its value only while it owns the capture (also honors `mouse_consumed`).
- [x] **P1 — Checkbox fallback rendering** when icon textures aren't loaded.
      `Checkbox` now defaults to a theme-driven vector box + contrast checkmark
      (no atlas assets, never blank). Opt into textures via
      `Checkbox::with_icons(SpriteId, SpriteId)` (pre-resolved, guaranteed
      non-blank) or `with_icon_keys(&str, &str)` for knowingly-preloaded keys.

---

## Layout

- [x] **P1 — Min/max size constraints.** `Constraint { min, max }`
      (`Constraint::min`/`max`/`between`, CSS semantics: min overrides max)
      clamps a resolved dimension orthogonally to `SizeSpec`. `Size` gained
      `min_width`/`max_width`/`min_height`/`max_height`; `VStack`/`HStack` gained
      `.constrain(Constraint)` applied to the last-added child. (Single-pass for
      `Fill` — a clamped fill child doesn't redistribute slack.)
- [x] **P1 — Per-child alignment within stack cells** (Center/Start/End on
      cross axis). `CrossAlign` enum (Start/Center/End/Stretch), `align()`
      builder on VStack and HStack. VStack respects alignment on the width
      axis, HStack on the height axis. `src/layout.rs`.
- [x] **P1 — Content-driven children.** The concrete gap (`content_size` always
      0.0 for `Fill`/`Percent`) is addressed by per-child alignment: `Fill` and
      `Percent` children now have proper `cross_size` control via alignment, and
      `Stretch` fills the cross-axis span as before. Full generic-child content
      driving (passing `impl LayoutNode` into stacks instead of raw pixel sizes)
      deferred to P2 as a larger API refactor. `src/layout.rs`.
- [x] **P1 — Z-order / layers** (required for popups/modals). `LayerStack`
      provides ordered Modal/Popup/Tooltip layers; `UiRenderer::render_layers`
      renders base → layers in order.
- [ ] **P2 — Weighted children** beyond equal-share `Fill`.
- [ ] **P2 — Wrap / flow layout** (inventory grids, mod lists).
- [ ] **P2 — Stable node IDs in `LayoutResult`** instead of positional indices
      (today `Vec<Rect>` indexed numerically, fragile under reordering).
- [ ] **P2 — Borrow/arena API for `LayoutResult.rects`** to avoid per-frame
      heap allocations.

---

## Input & Focus

- [x] **P0 — Real focus model.** Caller-owned `FocusState`/`FocusId`
      (mirrors `DragCapture`/`DragId`) is the single focus owner: at most one
      widget focused at a time. `TextInput.draw(id, &mut focus, …)` registers
      itself in the draw-order Tab ring and requests focus on click; Tab /
      Shift-Tab cycle, Esc and click-elsewhere blur, only the focused input
      consumes keys. `TextInput.focused: bool` removed. Modal-scoped Tab
      trapping deferred (see below).
- [x] **P1 — Modal/popup-scoped Tab trapping.** Tab cycling is scoped to the
      active layer via `FocusState::register_layer(id, layer_idx)` and
      `end_frame(Some(layer_idx))`. Base layer focusables are excluded from
      Tab order when a modal/popup is active. Click-to-focus already respects
      `mouse_consumed`. `DrawContext.register_focus(id)` auto-scopes based on
      `DrawContext.active_layer`. (`src/widgets/focus.rs`,
      `src/widgets/mod.rs`)
- [x] **P0 — Full key event model.** `InputState` now has `key_left`,
      `key_right`, `key_home`, `key_end`, `key_delete`, `shift_pressed`,
      `ctrl_pressed`. Arrows/Home/End/Delete on physical keys; Shift/Ctrl as
      held modifiers. Ctrl+A/X/C/V handled via ASCII control codes in
      `text_input` or `ctrl_pressed` + letter. Blocks usable text editing.
- [x] **P0 — Hit-testing respects clip stack and z-order.** Layer-aware
      input dispatch via `InputState::mouse_consumed` +
      `LayerStack::input_for_layer`/`input_for_base`. `is_hovered()` honors
      the flag automatically. (Note: existing widgets that call
      `rect.contains(input.mouse_x, ...)` directly should additionally AND
      with `!input.mouse_consumed` — `Table` and the example already do.)
- [ ] **P1 — Multi-button mouse** (right click, middle click) for context
      menus.
- [ ] **P1 — Double-click and click-and-hold distinction** (timestamps).
- [ ] **P1 — Drag detection on `InputState`** (`is_dragging`, `drag_delta`)
      so widgets stop reinventing it.
- [ ] **P1 — Scroll wheel propagation/capture** with a "consumed" flag for
      overlapping scroll regions.
- [ ] **P1 — IME / composition** for CJK/accented input.
- [ ] **P1 — Keyboard navigation** (Tab/Space-to-activate, arrows in lists).
- [ ] **P2 — Controller / gamepad** input abstraction.
- [ ] **P2 — Explicit `Frame`/`Ui` builder** that consumes input and produces
      a draw list, instead of implicit `end_frame` that callers can forget.

---

## Text

- [x] **P0 — Real text measurement** via glyphon shaping. Centering today
      uses `len() * font_size * 0.5` in 6+ places; broken for proportional
      fonts, multi-byte UTF-8, non-ASCII. (Teardown ships `UiGetTextSize` for
      this reason.)
- [x] **P0 — Text selection.** Caret state, shift+arrow selection,
      click-to-position-cursor, selection highlight rendering, Ctrl+A select all,
      proper backspace/delete. (`src/widgets/text_input.rs`)
- [x] **P0 — Copy/paste / clipboard hooks.** Closure-based clipboard API on
      `TextInput` (`clipboard_get`/`clipboard_set`). Users wire the platform
      clipboard (e.g. `arboard`). Cut/copy/paste (Ctrl+X/C/V) when closures are
      set.
- [x] **P0 — Font system.** Runtime font loading (`load_font_file`/
      `load_font_bytes` → `FontHandle`), per-`TextBlock` font selection
      (`with_font`/`with_font_opt`), bold/italic/weight (`TextBlock::bold()`/
      `italic()`/`with_weight()`/`with_style()`, threaded through the shape
      cache + measurement), a bundled default font (Noto Sans, behind the
      default-on `bundled-font` feature → deterministic `Family::SansSerif` via
      `register_bundled_fonts`), `Theme.font` driving every widget, and the
      Teardown `UiFont(family,size)` push/pop font stack on `UiContext`
      (`font`/`font_size`/`font_family`/`bold`/`italic`/`text_line`).
      cosmic-text's script/glyph fallback is automatic. (Synthetic bold/oblique
      for absent faces is out of scope — cosmic-text selects real faces only.)
- [ ] **P1 — Multi-line `TextInput` / textarea.** Enter is consumed as a
      separate event, never inserted.
- [ ] **P1 — Text wrapping policy.** `max_width` set, but smaller-than-text
      causes silent truncation. `UiWordWrap` exists in Teardown.
- [x] **P1 — Ellipsis on overflow.** `TextBlock::with_ellipsis` lays the text
      on one line and truncates with an `…` reserved at the right edge
      (`ellipsize_to_width` in `src/text.rs`); opt-in, no-op when the text fits.
- [x] **P1 — Cursor x-position from real shaping**, not the same broken
      `len*0.5` formula.
- [ ] **P2 — Password / masked input.**
- [ ] **P2 — RTL / bidi exposure** (glyphon supports it; no public knob).

---

## Theming / Styling

- [x] **P0 — DPI / scale factor** propagated through renderer; affects
      glyphon resolution, vertex output, layout. Teardown's `UiScale` exists
      (~1.2k mod calls). `UiRenderer::render`/`render_layers` take a
      `scale_factor`; the ortho is built from the logical size while the
      framebuffer stays physical (MSDF text self-sharpens via `fwidth`).
- [x] **P1 — Multiple fonts / sizes / weights** (see font system above) —
      per-`TextBlock` family/size/weight/style, `Theme.font`, and the
      `UiContext` font stack all land this.
- [ ] **P1 — Per-widget style override** without copying the whole `Theme`.
- [ ] **P1 — Extensible theme** (typed style map / `HashMap<StyleKey,
      StyleValue>`) so custom widgets don't need core changes.
- [ ] **P1 — Hover/press animation clock + transitions / easing.** Today
      colors switch immediately.
- [ ] **P2 — Theme stack** (push tint/color), tied to A5/D8 above.
- [ ] **P2 — Move semantic policy out of theme.** `progress_fill`/`_low`
      colors encode "low = red"; should be a thresholds struct or callback.

---

## Game / Teardown-Specific

- [x] **P0 — Lua-binding-friendly facade** (`UiContext` with state stack)
      that backs `UiText`/`UiTextButton`/`UiImageBox`/`UiSlider`/etc. as
      stateful immediate-mode calls. `UiContext` (push/pop,
      translate/rotate/scale, align/center, color/color_filter, place_rect,
      quad/rounded_rect/text_block) plus the font stack landed earlier; the
      interactive mode (`UiContext::interactive`/`interactive_layers` +
      caller-owned `UiState`) now provides the auto-advancing stateful verbs
      `text`/`text_button`/`slider`/`checkbox`/`image_box`/`text_input`.
      Remaining: UI sound hooks (tracked separately below).
- [x] **P0 — World-space UI** (`UiWorldToPixel`/`UiWorldToScreen`) for
      in-world labels, damage numbers, health bars over NPCs.
      `projection::world_to_screen`/`world_to_screen_na` project a world
      point to UI pixel space (None behind the camera).
- [ ] **P1 — UI sound hooks.** `UiSound`/`UiSoundLoop` and button
      hover/press sounds.
- [ ] **P1 — Mod-friendly registration** of custom widgets/styles
      (`register_widget(name, draw_fn)`, `register_style(name, value)`).
- [ ] **P1 — `UiMakeInteractive` / hit-zones independent of draw** for
      sensors over 3D things.
- [ ] **P2 — Cursor state control** (`UiSetCursorState`, I-beam over text).
- [ ] **P2 — Backdrop blur** (`UiBlur`) for menu screens.
- [ ] **Out of scope but don't block:** depth-aware `DrawSprite`/`DrawLine`
      in 3D world space — keep UI overlay vs. world overlay passes
      separable.

---

## Testing & Docs

- [x] **P1 — Widget tests.** Every widget module has `#[cfg(test)]` with
      headless `DrawList` tests; `text_input.rs` alone has 20+ tests, and
      `draw_list.rs`, `scroll_view.rs`, `button.rs`, `dropdown.rs`, etc. all
      have test suites. The TODO description was stale — tests existed at the
      time the repo was extracted from citybuilder and audits hadn't caught
      them. (Confirmed 2026-04-27: every `src/widgets/*.rs` except `mod.rs`
      has `#[cfg(test)]`.)
- [x] **P1 — `examples/` directory with at least one runnable wgpu
      example.** `examples/hello_ui.rs` opens a window and renders a panel +
      button + icon + nine-slice + text via `UiRenderer`.
- [ ] **P2 — Rustdoc on all public types.** Several lack it: `Vertex`,
      `IconDraw`, `NineSliceDraw`, `LayoutResult`, `StackChild`,
      `DrawContext::*`.
- [ ] **P2 — README quickstart, widget gallery, architecture overview.**
- [ ] **P2 — Bench suite** (`benches/`) for hot paths (text shaping, draw
      list construction, layout).

---

## Suggested 1.0 Roadmap (in priority order)

1. **Renderer + atlas** — ship a working `UiRenderer` and texture atlas; the
   crate currently can't actually draw quads/sprites/nine-slices.
2. **Rounded rects + lines + clip stack** — foundational primitives that
   unlock proper-looking UI and scroll views.
3. **Matrix-stack `UiContext`** (push/pop/translate/align/color) — required
   for Teardown port, dramatically improves widget ergonomics.
4. **ScrollView + modal/popup layer** — enables dropdown, color picker,
   drag handle, etc.
5. **Real text editing**: focus model, full key events, selection,
   clipboard.
6. **Font system + DPI scaling.**
7. **Dropdown, Image, ImageButton** — closes biggest widget gaps.
8. **Real text measurement** (glyphon-backed) — fixes alignment everywhere.
9. **Layout: min/max, alignment, content-driven children.**
10. **Widget API unification + widget tests + runnable example.**

Beyond 1.0: world-space UI, sound hooks, mod registry, color picker,
collapsing header, blur backdrop, controller input.
